# BoomBikes Linear Regression Analysis

## ðŸŒ† Introduction

In today's urbanized environment, bike-sharing systems have become pivotal in championing sustainability. These systems seamlessly blend technology, logistics, and user-centric design. An integral part is the "dock" - an automated station where users can access bikes after making a payment, and the flexibility to return the bike to any station in the network.

## ðŸš´ Challenge

BoomBikes, a renowned US bike-sharing provider, is grappling with the challenges presented by the Covid-19 pandemic. This global health crisis has dramatically altered urban mobility patterns, causing a substantial revenue dip for BoomBikes. In anticipation of a post-pandemic "new normal", BoomBikes is strategizing to adapt to these changes.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

The central goal is to discern the determinants of bike-sharing demand in the post-pandemic era. The objectives are:

1. Identify the significant factors influencing the demand for shared bikes.
2. Quantify the influence of these determinants on bike demand.

With this information, BoomBikes intends to revamp its offerings, aligning with the new-age consumer requirements, hoping to lead the market transformation.
